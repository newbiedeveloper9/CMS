# CMS

Main goal of the project is to present high quality code written by me. Also I believe that I can improve in many ways by maintaining an existing project.

## Project Structure

Structure | Framework | Project Location
------------ | -------------|--------------
API | ASP.NET Core 3.0 API | src/Cms.Api
Domain | .NET Standard 2.1 | src/Cms.Domain
Infrastructure | .NET Standard 2.1 | src/Cms.Infrastructure
Unit Tests | xUnit | tests/Cms.*.UnitTests
Frontend | React / MaterialUI | Cms.Api.ClientApp (temporary) 

## Status
