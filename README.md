# CMS

Main goal of the project is to present high quality code written by me. Also I believe that I can improve in many ways by maintaining an existing project.

## Project Structure

Structure | Framework | Project Location
------------ | -------------|--------------
API | ASP.NET Core 3.0 API | Cms.Api
Domain | .NET Standard 2.1 | Cms.Domain
Infrastructure | .NET Standard 2.1 | Cms.Infrastructure
Frontend | React / MaterialUI | Cms.Api.ClientApp (temporary) 

## Demo
